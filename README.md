Scripts for parsing the iOS message database.

Messages.app on OS X and iOS both store their messages databases in SQL (chat.db and sms.db, respectively). This is a handful of scripts which extract the messages from the SQL into human-readable JSON, and create some pretty HTML pages for browsing my archive.

At least, thatâ€™s the idea. Very much a work-in-progress.
